# Food Truck Project

## Description
Yelp has gone down and something has to take it's place. Enter, Relp. The very limited but soon to be replacement for yelp. Upon start, the program will greet you and ask you to enter up to 5 food trucks along with the type of food you ate as well as the rating you will give the food truck you ate at. 

Once you have entered your food trucks and relevant information, a new menu will appear giving you a couple options. First is to see all food trucks that have been entered. Second you can look at the average rating of all the food trucks. Lastly, you can see the highest rated truck. The program will keep looping until you are ready to quit and choose the 4th option.

## Lessons Learned
With this project, I learned how everything fits together. I learned a lot more about parameters and using specific data types for methods. Additionally, I was able to put good practice into only having the main method be static. 

## Technologies used
